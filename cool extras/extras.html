        <h1>Cool Extras!</h1>
        In this section, I will discuss some interesting data that arises from the Spotify Dataset.

        <h2>Similar Attributes:</h2>
        The similarity of two attributes represents the amount of shared songs between the two attributes. 
        I.e. two attributes are similar when a song having one attribute gives a high likelihood that the song will also have the other.
        The top three pairs of most similar attributes from the subset of songs from 1970-2030 includes: <br>
        <ul>
            <li>very low loudness & very low energy</li>
            <li>very low energy & very high acousticness</li>
            <li>very low loudness & very high acoustcness</li>
        </ul>
        Unsurprisingly, a song having very low loudness is often associated with very low energy. The more interesting part is the link between high acousticness and low energy. 
        Intuitively, acoustic music is calmer and is less harsh then usual music as by definition, it uses traditional instruments rather than electronic sound.

        <h2>The 70s</h2>
        The top attributes of the 70s are low loudness, low energy, and high acousticness. Although disco
        was one of the most established trends of the 70s, the decade was also 
        characterized by new wave, pop, and soft rock which brought in acoustic and
        relative low energy sounds compared to contemporary music ("History of modern music...")

            <embed type='text/html' src='1970_energy.html' width='280' height='500'>
            <embed type='text/html' src='1970_loudness.html' width='280' height='500'>
        </div>

        One representative song of the time- which is characterized by both high popularity and high similarity
        to the rest of the songs of the 70s- is Dreams by Fleetwood Mac. You can return by right clicking
        the page and pressing back if you decide to listen to it <a href='https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y3ywicffOj4'>here</a>. 
        The song is part of the Soft Rock genre ("Dreams...", 2021).

        <h2>The 80s</h2>
        The top attributes of the 80s are very low speechiness, very low liveness, and very high valence. 
        The advent of Music Television (MTV) in the 80s "dramatically changed" music by bolstering the 
        importance of the appearance of an artist ("History of modern music..."). Furthermore, with the 
        advent of Computers, electronic sounds were becoming more common ("History of modern music...").
        This is perhaps why we no longer see the high instrumentalness that was a part of the 80s.

            <embed type='text/html' src='1980_valence.html' width='280' height='500'>
        </div>

        One representative song of that time is Everybody Wants to Rule The World by Tears For Fears. You can return by right clicking
        the page and pressing back if you decide to listen to it <a href='https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aGCdLKXNF3w'>here</a>. 

        <h2>The 90s</h2>
        The top attributes of the 90s are low tempo, very low speechiness, and medium high loudness. Especially compared
        to the 70s, the 90s hosted a spread of musical genres and styles ("History of modern music..."). 
        Most notably, both highly produced pop songs and rap were popular, with "powerful singers" like
        Mariah Carey, Celine Dion, and Whitney Houston becoming signature artists of that decade ("History of modern music...").
        Note the distributions below. The "split" nature of 90s music can be seen by double peaks in tempo and
        speechiness, which likely correspond to the two juggernauts of the time, hip-hop and pop.

        </div>
        
        One representative song of that time is All I Want for Christmas Is You by Mariah Carey. You can return by right clicking
        the page and pressing back if you decide to listen to it <a href='https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yXQViqx6GMY'>here</a>. 

        <h2>The 2000s and 2010s</h2>
        The top attributes of the 2000s and 2010s are both very high loudness, high loudness, and very high speechiness. The 2000s
        introduced genres like Emo, but largely carried on the momentum of the 90s with pop music ("History of modern music...").
         Note that like the 90s, the 2000s carries an evenish distribution of speechiness. However, unlike the 90s, the peak
         in speechiness is on the opposite side of the spectrum - very high. This could signify a transition towards
         more lyric-based music like that of Eminem who rose to prominence in this period. Interestingly, there was little
         change between the 2000s and 2010s hence why I grouped them together.

        <h2>The 2020s</h2>
        At the time of this project, only about ~1/10 of the 2020s has been completed. But in this short period, the top attributes
        are very high speechiness, very high danceability, and very high loudness. Like the 2000s and 2010s, there is a shared
        focus of rap and hip-hop (Sheffield, 2020). Interstingly, there seems to be an increase in focus on highly danceable songs.
        Perhaps this comes from a resurgence of R&B and the rise of the electronic dance genre, House ("Most Popular...").
